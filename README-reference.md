## Client Storage

Of localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, indexedDB, using indexedDB for large file size.

Where success is undifferentiated (say, infantry or tank hits each inflict a generic casualty), a one-dimensional matrix may represent the likelihood of 'n' hits for infantry, and another one-dimensional matrix for 'o' hits for tanks; the two matrices are convoluted to arrive at a single lengthier one-dimensional array.  (if 'a' infantry with matrix 'a+1' length, 'b' tanks with matrix 'b+1' length; combined for a+b+1 length.)

However, if success is differentiated (say, submarines can only hit naval units, while cruisers can hit anything), we create a two-dimensional matrix where a value's column index represents number of successes of type A, row index number of successes of type B.  This is a joint probability mass function, or contingency table (perhaps, look up to confirm).
